# websploit
a side project by me, uses websockets to help u win games
# faq
how to install
-> once i fully code everything and make the gui and stuff it will be avaiable

how does it work
-> it uses websockets to send and revcieve from the client (aka ur executor) and then u can execute code from the website to ur executor which will then execute it. the inject button is gonna have to be rebanrded
# to do
-DONE- move to tailwindcss@3 (took forever)

-DONE- remake the gui to be cleaner

-IN PROGRESS- recode some parts of the socket and client so that i can move to a new one time code systemn

-FUTURE- make the client side (executor) work

# future
idk
